Welcome — this page helps you get the Mach bootstrap toolchain built and the example CLI running. The instructions assume a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS) and a POSIX toolchain.

### Prerequisites

Before building **Mach**, make sure you have the following installed:

- **LLVM ≥ 19**
- **A C compiler** that supports the **C23** standard
- **Make** or an equivalent build tool

---

#### Verification

Before building Mach, ensure that:

- `llvm-config` is accessible in your `PATH`.
- LLVM’s development headers are properly installed.

### Getting Source

To get started, clone the Mach repository from its source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/octalide/mach.git
```


### Environment Variables

The compiler and other Mach projects depend on the `MACH_HOME` environment variable.  
Before creating or launching any tools, set this variable to the root directory of your Mach repository:

```bash 
export MACH_HOME="path/to/mach"
```

---

### Building the compiler

```bash
cd mach
make  cmach # produces a binary in out/bin/
```
<Aside> The build process expects **Clang** and **LLD** to be available in your `PATH`.  If you’re using a custom toolchain, set the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables, or update the `Makefile` accordingly.</Aside>

### Next steps
- Run `./out/bin/mach help` to list available commands.
- Modify `src/commands.mach` in the `mach` repo to add CLI subcommands.
- Track progress toward the self-hosted compiler in this repository — the goal is to replace the C bootstrap with a Mach-built compiler over time.
