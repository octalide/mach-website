A variable declaration has the following syntax: ```(val|var) identifier[: type] = value;```

#### Constants: ```val```

Syntax: ```val name: Type = expression;```

val must have an initializer and cannot be reassigned.
```c
val max_items: u64 = 1024;
val greeting: []u8 = []u8{ 'h', 'i' };
greeting = []u8{ 'x' };   # error: cannot assign to val
```


#### Variables: ```var```
Syntax: ```var name: Type;``` or ```var name: Type = expression;```
```c
# var may be declared without an initializer and can be reassigned.
var count: u64;
count = 1;

var total: u64 = 0;
total = total + count;

# type annotations are required; there is no type inference in declarations
var p: *u8;
p = nil;
```
